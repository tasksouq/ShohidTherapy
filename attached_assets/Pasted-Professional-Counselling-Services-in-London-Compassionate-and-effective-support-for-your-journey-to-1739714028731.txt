About Me
I am an integrative counsellor dedicated to providing compassionate and effective support to individuals seeking personal growth and well-being. My approach is grounded in a blend of Person-Centred, Gestalt, Cognitive Behavioural (CBT), and Transactional Analysis (TA) therapies.

My background includes experience in policy and strategy, as well as youth justice, giving me a broad understanding of the challenges people face in different contexts. Witnessing the positive impact counselling had on a family member inspired me to pursue this path.

I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), adhering to their ethical framework for good practice.

My Approach
I believe that each person possesses the inherent capacity for self-discovery and healing. My approach is rooted in person-centred principles, emphasizing warmth, understanding, and a non-judgmental space.
