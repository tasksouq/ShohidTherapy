
About Me
Hi there, I'm Shohid. Are you feeling overwhelmed, lost, or simply seeking to understand yourself better? I'm an integrative counsellor dedicated to helping people navigate life's challenges and unlock their full potential.

I offer a compassionate and supportive therapeutic relationship built on trust and understanding. My approach is integrative, meaning I draw from a range of evidence-based therapies, including Person-Centred, Gestalt, CBT, and Transactional Analysis, to create a personalised approach for each client.

I have for over two decades, worked with vulnerable children and adults, gaining valuable insight into the diverse challenges people encounter. My own personal experience with the positive impact of counselling inspired me to train as a therapist.

I'm a registered member of the BACP, working within their ethical framework. I believe in the inherent capacity for self-healing and growth, and I'm here to support you on your journey in a safe, non-judgmental space.

Our first step is an assessment session, where you can discuss what's troubling you, I can outline my approach, and we can explore whether we're a good fit to work together.

Training, qualifications & experience
I am an honorary counsellor with Step Forward and Headstrong. I am a BACP registered counsellor with a CPCAB Level 4 Diploma in Therapeutic Counselling (and I am currently completing the CPCAB Level 5 in Psychotherapeutic Counselling).

I have 20 years' experience working with vulnerable children and adults, including roles in youth justice, running a youth club in Botswana, and family support.
